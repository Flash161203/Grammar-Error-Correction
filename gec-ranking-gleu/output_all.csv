"It is undoubtedly true that in today's economy world people commute to work by their private vehicles. It seems more convenient to them to move on their own own costs than tied to a public transport. It can be causing that public transport system has been carries by its popularity ways. People feel that they can get to their destinations on time if they drive their own car. It is true for many cases as public transport like buses, trains and trams have their own specific routes and stops. This may cause people to get late to their particular destination. Secondly, public transport seems to be going to travel a car by day which has reduced its popularity. People might find cars more affordable for them. In modern society, cars have become more cheaper to buy, which in turn has helped people to have them. Moreover, governments are <unk> more affordable for them.

Recently, things have been accidenting from our homes. We have called the police, but they ignore us. The first few days, they replied the city and helped us.

I would like the local town council to help us find out what is happening. People are afraid and we need help urgently. I would also like you to talk to the police department, because the police have to do their job and make sure we are all safe, not to ignore us and say that everything is fine.

"First of all, I lived in London for three weeks in Recently, I am a teacher in a high school and the authorities in my country lets me stay it, improving my English. I would like to say that learning any languages is complicated to someone, whatever you come from, but in my opinion, there are many matter to discuss. A good way of this would be children. One child whose parents come from different countries is able to learn two languages at the same time, this child doesn't need to go abroad to learn a foreign language, but they are listening to their parents speaking English their native language all the time and this, let them learn without any difficulty. On the other hand, if you go abroad, you will be able to improve your English in an <unk>, in this case, your knowledge will be you with your stay there. To sum up, if you want to learn English, you don't need to go abroad, you can improve your English working hard at your own country. For example, doing exercises like listening and writing or you can meet with native people who speak English to do with them. But if you have one opportunity to go abroad, this would be so good for you and your English."

"I's believed that it's better to work on your own than work as a group. First, I have agree with this, but then when I started to think about it, I realized that it's not like that. Firstly, I think that if you work as a team, you can help each other and if you have more people and more completely answer because you have the ideas and the knowledge of every single member of the group. Secondly, I think that the members of the team gives you support, love and company. Sometimes the members of a group began to be so close to you that you love them the same as if they were part of your family. Moreover, if it is a really nice group, it is fun fun to work with them than to work alone. In conclusion, I believe that it's better to work as a team than to work on your own because they give you love, company and you could pass a very good time."

"Many people believe that public transport will be replaced by private one in the nearest future. The main reason is the convenience of travelling by car in comparison with using public transport. Apart from that, there are many other benefits in buying a car instead of using buses or underground every day. First of all, an automobile gives such a valuable thing as privacy. For example, driving a car we can wear whatever we want and listen to music on any properties. If the car is large enough, it can be even a perfect place for sleep. Additionally, if we are eager to travel outside the town in order to have some rest from a daily rhythm of life, it will be more comfortable for us to use our cars. Only our own vehicle can provide us with an opportunity to find any quiet and pleasant place outside the city. Public transport can take us to not have to certain restrictions. Thus, it is clear that private transport such as auto numbers has plenty of advantages. On the other hand, we can be stuck with different problems while travelling by car. For instance, being in traffic jams, always stealings much our precious time. Car drivers are the typical reason for this phenomenon. It means that travelling by car can even be more dangerous than using public transport. Generally, buses are much more organized than automobile ones, therefore, accidents caused by public transport has causedy rarely. This makes travelling by public transport more safer. Thus, I would argue that driving a car requires much attention and understanding that careless behaviour on the road can make a serious damage to other people. In conclusion, I believe that public transport will eventually lose its Fance due to the fact that all people want to be independent and travel on their own. "

If this. <unk>  that the future, I think that today we argue our future. I am sure sure about one thing: technology will have a more important place in our lives.

Maybe in 50 years we will find out how our brain works and we will be able to create an artificial maturity system that would solve all our problems. I would like to think that in the future we will cope more the land and we will seise other planets. Maybe by doing this, we would be able to find other civilisations and exchange technologies with them. I'd like to think that we will find a way to travel through the land at the local trials than the speed of light. I don't think that people will live forever in 50 years, but I hope that the life of our children will be better than ours. Hopefully, I have enough to be alive in 50 years, so maybe I will see the future with my own eyes."

"Dear Dateionalalia advertised Writing task:<unk>al letter Dear Jenny, How are you doing? As you know, I’m planning to go to England to renew up on my English. I really appreciate it if you could give me a piece of advice about what course should I take. I’d like you to take into account the following requirements. Firstly, my main target is to improve English and writing skills as I don’t feel confident enough to do such tasks. S<unk> college should be used to teaching these matters properly. Secondly, I’d like the college to be located not too far from accommodation if possible. I wouldn’t like to spend too much time on public transport every day. As far as native is concerned, I'd like bed and breakfast included in the price. Finally, my overall budget policy <unk>. Would it be enough for a two-gol course in England? If it's not please let me know. Well, we’ll keep in touch and thank you very much for all your help. Best regardsfully "
"It was the worst night we had ever had. We had never gone to Michael's house before. We were thinking that meeting there we would have a fun night in friends, but we were very wrong. When we arrived, we saw an old house where Michael lived. He was waiting for us outside. At first, we didn't think that something bad was going to happen. When we got inside his house, we saw a lot of old movie on his wall. It was like a horror movie! Michael looked very nervous too. After a while, when we were playing one of his feelings game, we heard a scream coming from his garden. There were two bodies in that place. They were Michael's parents. His father was dead, but his mum no. Then, Michael tried to hide their bodies in a room, without knowing that his mum was alive. When we saw that we had discovered as fast as we could, and we saw as his mum walking to find Michael, like a knife. In the end, we heard Michael's scream. We never see him again. I thought that when Michael closed the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake. "

"One very person once said: 'The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page.'s writing agree with this statement and, to my mind, people should travel a lot because our world is incredible. But there is one more question: travelling by car or public transport? First of all, of time, travelling by car is much more convenient than, for example, by bus. You can drive wherever and whenever you want. Even just in cities, let it alone at long distances. But, on the other hand, traffic jams or bad weather can make our trip inconvenient. Moreover, there are not many parking places in big cities. Secondly, travelling by public transport is much cheaper. Not all people can afford travelling by car every day so they choose public transport. Thirdly, we should take care of our environment! Cars pollute our air what leads to many diseases such as non- inter and allergies and even cancer. Moreover, cars infinite fum rates fumvo fumes and dust into the air, which represent with the water in the clouds, and the polluted rain, which later <unk>, factory and buildings. So, my advice is to travel by bicycle (at least, use public transport) because it is environmentally friendly!"

The main advantage of learning per Internet is time saving. When we attend a school, we often waste time on buses which we may try to study. In case of the Internet learning, we can oneself set hours of learning. Also, the possibility of learning at home is a big advantage, especially for people who prefer peace and literally. Then it's better to concentrate of learning and we don't feel any pressure or stress connected with asking and tests.

"In my opinion, public transport in my country will never improve because my country is so poor and <unk> it is considered one of the third world countries and other things must be taken into consideration is they are the most dangerous our country."
"There is no doubt that travelling by car is the most comfortable option, but enhancing public transport has no future is too much. Many people use public transport on a daily basis. There are people who wouldn't be able to travel if it wasn't for a driving, if they need to go anywhere, using public transport is their only option. Travelling by car is also very, for the environment. In big cities, the air is very polluted because there are too many cars. Travelling by public transport producess the impact on the environment, something that most people are aware of, but still prefer to use their own vehicle. Using public transport can also save time, since you don't have to spend their own vehicle. Using public transport can also save time, since you don't have to spend time looking for a place to park your car. I definitely think that public transport will continue to be very important in the future. "

"My favorite sport is football. It's the most popular sport in the world. I enjoy it because it's known known and easy to find partners to play to play with. Watching football is also a wonderful experience. My favorite international league is the English choir' hobbies. My advice anyone who is starting this sport is to start it early and play it regularly not to translate fitness. Also, joining a team will be a great idea."

Especially some people don't have a car and some elderly people who are difficult to drive a car by themselves, public transport helpss us a lot. Public transport has been improved and that makes it comfortable to go on a trip, but I think that will be able to become good quality more and more, because so many people while. I like a car as well, but when I have to drive a car, I have to think about parking a lot and I can't enjoy meet other people to talk while I am having travelling, so public transport is making education with human beings.

"My favourite sport is rafts because it is the only game for our mind. It also helps us in studies. I agree that it's not physical exercise, but a mental one. There are many physical exercise, like swimming but name, any game except chess that makes our mind sharp. I like many other games, but the best one is that. I am not saying that we should always play chess as physical activities are also important. The reason why I would advise someone this sport is that the children who are not interested in it studies or not be able to study. In that case, chess would help him. It would make child mind sharp and he would not get distracted by the surroundings."

"PLANE, TRAIN OR BOAT? Everyone likes something more or less, even when it comes to little things. It is certain that each of us love to travel, but everyone likes the most comfortable means of transport. For me, the best way to travel is train, because I think this mode of transportation has the most. One of the things that is very important to me is the price. I'm not going to spend a lot of money for a ticket, because I'm studying so I just have a part-time job. If we check the prices of air travel, we can be disappointed as well as travelling by boat by boat. Fortunately the train tickets are cheaper. Another very important thing is the travel. Buses flop very quickly very quickly, but you have to be at the airport at least an hour earlier. In the case of a ship, travelling time is recommended. Travelling by train is quite fast, and pleasant, I can safely travel to more places worldwide than people take a boat or plane.... the the the   that is is is is is is is is is,,, I I            I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I  I I I I I  I I I I  I I I   I I I   I I I   I I   I I   I I   I I   I I   I I    I I   I I    I I   I I   I I   I I   I I   I I I  I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I"

"Have you ever heard a game that involves people running around a field and score goals by kicking a ball? Yes, it's football! And it is also known to be my favourite sport. I know that for some, playing football is boring, but for me, it's the most exciting thing ever. I'm a freak when it comes to football. I think I was watching all the football matches in history, especially when it was the <unk> Cup season. I would not sleep until the game was over. Although, I don't play really well, but I would choose it over any other sports any day. I enjoy playing football because the feeling you get when you are in the field is priceless. I would feel free when I'm in the field. I was told that I was a natural player when I was young. I didn't need any invitation since my football skills came naturally. I think that I got this from my dad and my elder brother. Both of them are just like me, we succeeded out when it comes to football! Reading of our nephew includes football and we can talk all day about it for sure. Here is some advice to someone who is starting to this sport. The longest is to play smoothly for the first time and make sure to use a football shop when you're playing in the field. This advice is to avoid you from in Piing yourself as a competition in football. "

"I want football in the future I think it is a good idea for children to travel on public transport. There are several reasons why I support this choice. First, it is unnecessary to spend more money on school buses, because by<unk> 5 children are able to take care of themselves and each other. They can communicate well and are aware of dangerous situations. For example, if they see a drunk or dirty people on public buses, they could avoid sitting near them or tourists them to the bus driver. Second, it is a good opportunity to educate them in life skills such as getting to sit in policy seats or leave litter on the bus. In contrast, I think that parents who insist their children should only travel on school buses, protect them too much. In daily life, many youngsters need to go to school and back by public transportation. In other words, if parents opposite their off the problems then they may become too dependent and discussions of many years in society later on. In conclusion, it is not only a good chance to take the children on an adventure, but also help them become independent young people. I think this way can help them in failureing for society early."

"Public transport has a big role in transportation, especially in large cities, like the car some cars caused traffic jams, whereas if all people use their own car, to avoid this way, a way is needed. Also, the cost of public transportation is lower than private transport. On the other hand, public transportation is fewer time to get to the required station, because already public transport takes a long route to go to place and, as more people, people take the benefits of it, and public transport is usually empty-saving and not not be on time. For that reason, using own car is more comfortable than public transport; you can travel when someone says you like and where ever you want. Finally, in the near future, most people will be using their own car, because it saves a lot of time as comparing public transport and time factor will be more expensive in the future."

"In terms of holidays, some people like to visit their own country, while others prefer going abroad. I think going abroad is much more exciting. Besides their own country certainly has its advantages. First of all, you don't have to take very long periods. Also, you can have the opportunity to discover new places, just next to your home. Besides, this type of vacation is usually less expensive than going abroad. On the other hand, many people prefer places. Actually, they like the idea of visiting an unknown land, where everything is different, from the weather to the habits. Furthermore, they also like going abroad to visit important and famous cities around the world, like Paris, Madrid, New York. In my opinion, traveling to a foreign country makes people open their minds to other cultures. In fact, going abroad is a nice way to make new friends, try new things and improve a foreign language. In addition, if you plan your vacation very soon, you can also save money on planes or hotels. In conclusion, I think it's important to know both their own countries and foreign <unk>. "
